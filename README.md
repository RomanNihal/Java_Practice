# Java Practice

This repository contains various Java programs and exercises, developed to practice and enhance Java programming skills. The projects cover different aspects of Java, including basic syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Features

### Java Fundamentals:
- Basic syntax and programming structure.
- Understanding of variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Implementation of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### Data Structures:
- Practice with arrays, lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, and other fundamental data structures.

### Algorithms:
- Implementation and understanding of common algorithms like sorting, searching, and recursion.

### Practical Applications:
- Simple applications and projects to demonstrate practical Java programming, such as a calculator, to-do list manager, etc.

### Problem Solving:
- Solutions to various programming challenges and problems to strengthen problem-solving abilities.
